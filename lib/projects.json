        "description": "Our group wanted to see the impact of having access to a car on UCSD studentsâ€™ social wellness and academic achievement. Through the survey data (142 participants) we analyzed factors including car ownership, social satisfaction, GPA, and variables such as living situation, academic workload, and major. We found that vehicle access alone does not significantly affect social life satisfaction or GPA. Regression analysis showed that factors such as major, year in school, and extracurricular involvement in conjunction with access to a personal vehicle play a larger role in influencing both social and academic success. While access to a car provides greater flexibility and social opportunities, that factor does not define one's level of satisfaction with their social life or GPA alone."

        "description": "I have always understood that eating healthy diet is an essential part of leading a healthy life, but unhealthy foods that are high in carbohydrates, sodium, fats, etc. tend to be more delicious and bring a lot of immediate happiness in the short term. This led me to question how this dilemma would be reflected in food reviews for recipes online. Would the health benefits of a food boost the reception of a recipe or is taste and satisfaction more important to reviewers?"
